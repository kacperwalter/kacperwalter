# Hi there 👋 
I am Kacper, frontend web developer with experience in long-term projects and working with marketing teams. Currently working at <a href="https://www.netguru.com/" style="color: #00d563;">Netguru</a>. In love with beautiful UI's & low-level web development with attention to detail and semantics. 

I am driven by long-term perspective instead of quick fix approach, can-do attitude and I'm pretty strong at googling 🤓
